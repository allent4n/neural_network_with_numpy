# neural_network_with_numpy
Build an neural network from scratch using Numpy only!

# In this Jupyter Notebook:
** You will learn how to build a simple neural network to recognize the A, B and C gray image using Numpy only
** You will learn how to code the forward function (i.e., Data from input to output)
** You will learn how to code the BACK PROPAGATION function (i.e., Modify the learning parameters/Training)

# Enjoy! ;D
