# neural_network_with_numpy
Build an neural network from scratch using Numpy only!

# In this Jupyter Notebook:
1. You will learn how to build a simple neural network to recognize the A, B and C gray image using Numpy only
2. You will learn how to code the forward function (i.e., Data from input to output)
3. You will learn how to code the BACK PROPAGATION function (i.e., Modify the learning parameters/Training)
4. Have a better understanding of NEURAL NETWORK before jumping to those complated ones

### Enjoy! ;D
